	<h3 style="color: #C21E2D;" >What is emotional intelligence or EQ?</h3>
       <p>
       		Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. Emotional intelligence helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at school and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and make informed decisions about what matters most to you. </p>
       <p>
       		Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes: </p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>
				Self-management</strong> – You’re able to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances. </li>
	<li><strong>
				Self-awareness</strong> – You recognize your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. You know your strengths and weaknesses, and have self-confidence. </li>
	<li><strong>
				Social awareness</strong> – You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognize the power dynamics in a group or organization. </li>
	<li><strong>
				Relationship management</strong> – You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict. 
    </li>
</ol>

	<H3>Why is emotional intelligence so important?</H3>
	<p>
		As we know, it’s not the smartest people who are the most successful or the most fulfilled in life. You probably know people who are academically brilliant and yet are socially inept and unsuccessful at work or in their personal relationships. Intellectual ability or your intelligence quotient (IQ) isn’t enough on its own to achieve success in life. Yes, your IQ can help you get into college, but it’s your EQ that will help you manage the stress and emotions when facing your final exams. IQ and EQ exist in tandem and are most effective when they build off one another. </p>
		<h4>
			Emotional intelligence affects:</h4>
	<p><i style="color: darkred;">
		Your performance at school or work.</i> High emotional intelligence can help you navigate the social complexities of the workplace, lead and motivate others, and excel in your career. In fact, when it comes to gauging important job candidates, many companies now rate emotional intelligence as important as technical ability and employ EQ testing before hiring. </p>
	<p><i style="color: darkred;">
		Your physical health.</i> If you’re unable to manage your emotions, you are probably not managing your stress either. This can lead to serious health problems. Uncontrolled stress raises blood pressure, suppresses the immune system, increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes, contributes to infertility, and speeds up the aging process. The first step to improving emotional intelligence is to learn how to manage stress. </p>
	<p><i style="color: darkred;">
		Your mental health.</i> Uncontrolled emotions and stress can also impact your mental health, making you vulnerable to anxiety and depression. If you are unable to understand, get comfortable with, or manage your emotions, you’ll also struggle to form strong relationships. This in turn can leave you feeling lonely and isolated and further exacerbate any mental health problems. </p>
	<p><i style="color: darkred;">
		Your relationships.</i> By understanding your emotions and how to control them, you’re better able to express how you feel and understand how others are feeling. This allows you to communicate more effectively and forge stronger relationships, both at work and in your personal life. </p>
	<p><i style="color: darkred;">
		Your social intelligence.</i> Being in tune with your emotions serves a social purpose, connecting you to other people and the world around you. Social intelligence enables you to recognize friend from foe, measure another person’s interest in you, reduce stress, balance your nervous system through social communication, and feel loved and happy. </p>
	
		<h4>
			Mindfulness is an ally of emotional and social awareness</h4>
	<p>
		To build social awareness, you need to recognize the importance of mindfulness in the social process. After all, you can’t pick up on subtle nonverbal cues when you’re in your own head, thinking about other things, or simply zoning out on your phone. Social awareness requires your presence in the moment. While many of us pride ourselves on an ability to multitask, this means that you’ll miss the subtle emotional shifts taking place in other people that help you fully understand them. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>You are actually more likely to further your social goals by setting other thoughts aside and focusing on the interaction itself. </li>
		<li>Following the flow of another person’s emotional responses is a give-and-take process that requires you to also pay attention to the changes in your own emotional experience. </li>
		<li>Paying attention to others doesn’t diminish your own self-awareness. By investing the time and effort to really pay attention to others, you’ll actually gain insight into your own emotional state as well as your values and beliefs. For example, if you feel discomfort hearing others express certain views, you’ll have learned something important about yourself. </li>
	</ul>
